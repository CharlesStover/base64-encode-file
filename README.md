# base64-encode-file
Encodes an entire file via base64.

## Use
`node index.js FILENAME` will take a the file `FILENAME` and output `FILENAME.base64`.

## Examples
`node index.js font.woff` will output `font.woff.base64`.

## Use Cases
The primary, personal purpose of this project was to convert font files to base64 so as to be able to include them inline in CSS.
